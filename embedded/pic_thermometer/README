This is a very old project I did using on a PIC16F876A.
It is basically a thermometer displaying current the current temperature on a LCD.

- The temperature sensor used is a DS1820 1-wire digital sensor IC.
- The LCD is the very well known HD44780.

There are other functionalities but I dont remember exactly :-) Probably a "breathing" effect led using PWM.
