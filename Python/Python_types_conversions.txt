Python types conversion clarification
-------------------------------------

by Marco Vedovati


ord(): string (as byte) to int. Takes as input a single-char string and
returns the ascii code as integer.

chr(): takes input an ascii code as integer and 
returns the associated character in '\x##'  format.


str(): integer/string/whatever to printable string conversion.

int(): takes as input a single  character in the format '\x##'
and returns its ascii code value as integer.


hex(): takes as input an integer number of whatever size and returns
as output a string in the format "0x####"

********
binascii module


hexlify(): takes as input a string and returns a string. For each
character of the input string it returns two characters representing
the ascii code of the char in hexadecimal format.

Equivalent to:
a = '%02X' %ord('A')

unhexlify(): takes as input a string and returns a string.
Characters in the input string must be even and between "0-9" and "A-F".
Each two character of the input string as considered as an hex value,
as output is returned the ASCII representation of it.



FAQ:

Q: how can i convert "00" to 0x00 ?
A: use binascii.unhexlify("00")

Q: how can i convert "00" or "0" to 0x00 automatically?
   what if is prepended by "0x" ? 
A: 

a = "0" #or "00"
if len(a)<=2 :
	binascii.unhexlify("0"+a)

#if prepended by 0x
a = a[2:]
#like before
